I am currently obtaining an MPhil in Technology Policy at the University of Cambridge as a [Gates Cambridge Scholar](https://news.mit.edu/2024/sadhana-lolla-gates-cambridge-scholar-0227). I'm also a visiting researcher at Stanford, where I work on test-time embodied reasoning with the [IRIS Lab](https://irislab.stanford.edu//index.html) and am advised by Chelsea Finn.
Previously, I earned a B.S. in computer science with minors in mathematics and literature from MIT. 

My research focuses broadly on robot learning and on designing and deploying uncertainty-aware artificial intelligence. 

At MIT, I was fortunate to have been advised by [Prof. Daniela Rus](http://danielarus.csail.mit.edu/) and [Dr. Alexander Amini](https://www.mit.edu/~amini/) at the Distributed Robotics Laboratory, where I worked on projects ranging from debiasing autonomous vehicles to developing more generalizeable control policies for soft robotics. 

I have also had the pleasure of working at Microsoft Research with [Dr. Ava Amini](https://avaamini.com/) on input uncertainty quantification and propagation, [Themis AI](https://themisai.io/) on uncertainty quantification in deep learning, [Google's Keras Team](https://keras.io/) on accelerating distributed training,  [Google's Discover Ranking Team](https://developers.google.com/search/docs/appearance/google-discover) on recommendation algorithms, and [Safar Partners](https://www.safar.partners/) on investing in artificial intelligence and robotics startups. 

Outside of research, I was an instructor and lead TA for [MIT's Introduction to Deep Learning Course](http://introtodeeplearning.com/), one of the most popular deep learning classes in the world. I have also served as the curriculum team lead for [Momentum AI](https://momentumai.org/).

In my free time, I enjoy [baking](https://www.instagram.com/lollabytes/), reading, and solving crossword puzzles.
